📢 Wasted Weekend - The Ultimate Job Pricing Calculator
🚀 Welcome to Wasted Weekend - where we turn the soul-sucking misery of quoting into something almost bearable.

Are you sick of manually calculating job prices, only to have your clients ghost you after you’ve done all the hard work?
Does your inner accountant cry every time you pull out an ancient spreadsheet that hasn’t been updated since the Jurassic era?

Well, cry no more! 🎉

With this highly sophisticated, professional, and absolutely not duct-taped-together tool, you can generate job quotes faster than your boss can say, "Can we make this free?"

🤖 What Does This Magical Thing Do?
✅ Lists all your fancy products (finally, no more digging through emails from 2014).
✅ Lets you enter quantities (because one laptop is never enough).
✅ Adds up all the numbers (maths? I don't know her).
✅ Emails quotes (so you can pretend you did real work).
✅ Labels unknown items as "Special Order - POA" (because who actually knows what clients are talking about?).
✅ Sends all quotes as PDFs (because PDFs make things look legit).
✅ Aggregates all quotes into a CSV (for reasons).
✅ Connects to a calendar (because "sometime next week" isn’t a real appointment).
✅ Offers upsells (SmartAssist! More SmartAssist! Even SmarterAssist!).
✅ Uses Officeworks & Geeks2U branding (because branding is life).

bash
Copy
Edit

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
4️⃣ Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (so someone else can blame the server when it doesn’t work)

💀 Warning: Your Sanity May Be at Risk
This app has been lovingly built with caffeine, frustration, and a deep-rooted fear of deadlines. If it breaks:

Try turning it off and on again (it works 80% of the time, every time).
Blame JavaScript (it's always JavaScript).
Call IT support (aka, yourself).
If you actually read this README, congratulations. You are now an honorary member of the Wasted Weekend Survivors Club. 🎖️

🛠️ Tech Stack (a.k.a. "What This Frankenstein is Made Of")
🖥 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (because React was too much effort).
⚙ Backend: Node.js, Express (because why not).
📦 Data Storage: JSON & CSV (because databases scare me).
📩 Email: Some magic API that hopefully works.
📆 Calendar: Another API that probably works.
📊 Deploy: Vercel, Netlify, or wherever feels right.

📣 Final Words of Wisdom
Remember: This project is like an IKEA desk – looks great, might fall apart if you breathe on it wrong. But it’s all part of the fun, right?

Now go forth, deploy, and may your quotes always land you a profitable client instead of another "Can I pay in exposure?" offer.

🫡 Good luck!
